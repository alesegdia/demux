# Post-mortem

Demux wanted to be a procedurally generated metroidvania. It was going to be submitted for some libgdx jam during one month, but I didn't finish it on time. The map generation and restriction system is working though and it was so funny to work on it. The generator can be used apart from the project. It is called [troidgen](https://github.com/alesegdia/troidgen).
